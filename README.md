> **TaskWhere** is a location aware **task management application** notifies you when you have a task nearby you provided before using proximity alert.

# Documentation

Open up **taskwhere** application, add new task by providing task location, task itself, proximity radius and location of the task. You can provide location either by using current location, drag&drop or searching address. When you done, save your task and you are ready to go. When you enter location of the task (with given proximity radius) TaskWhere warn you about your task with nice notification. Not completed the task at first time ? Dont worry TaskWhere will warn you when you leave proximity area cause you may need second chance to do it.

You can do basic operations on tasks like edit, delete, mark as done, activate and deactivate.
